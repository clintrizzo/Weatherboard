# Weatherboard
I built this project to display the weather for a city. Setting the current forecast to a card from boot strap and adding the five day projected weather on another card from bootstrap. In the current weather display it shows the current weather conditions with an appended image. I also appened the temp, humidity, and wind speed. In the search bar it will display the previous cities that you have searched.

# Issues
The main issues that I ran into were that I couldn't get the null to be removed from the list. They would be removed after I removed the script from bootstrap but then the buttons wouldn't work.
